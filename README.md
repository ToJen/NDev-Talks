## Usage:
1. The `slides/` folder contains the downloaded presentation from SlideBean. You can view it [here](https://tinyurl.com/yaaslzx8).

2. In the `src/` folder:
   * `index.html` is a basic webpage and `scrape.py` is a Python script that demonstrates scraping it
   * `scrape_imdb.py` will extract the details of the top 250 movies on IMDb and outputs `movie_details_shallow.csv`
   * `play.py` will attempt to solve the popular 2048 game, originally made by [Gabriele Cirulli](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli)
   
3. To start a script, run `python <SCRIPT_NAME_GOES_HERE_WITHOUT_BRACKETS>` in your terminal or command line.
